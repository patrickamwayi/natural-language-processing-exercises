We are extremely proud of the progress we’ve made as a staff and Codeup community, and we recognize there is more to learn. This report captures some of the ways that we’ve lived our value of Cultivating Inclusive Growth, and how we will continue doing so as we look to the future. We wanted to shine a light on the demographics of our students and staff, and in particular how that compares to the tech industry as a whole. How we collect, organize, and share employee demographic data is informed by standards set by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). We are proud to celebrate how we’ve grown and are motivated and committed to do more and be better. To view the report visit the link here, or download it below.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Deciding to transition into a tech career is a big step and a more significant commitment. Often after deciding to commit to a journey of this nature, the main obstacle is finding a way to finance your training. At Codeup, we recognize that many of our students are career transitioners, and attending one of our programs can sometimes require sacrifice. Luckily, we have several ways to help you finance your career transition, ultimately leading to that new career you’ve decided to pursue. Programs We offer three different accelerated coding bootcamps at Codeup including Full-Stack Web Development, Cloud Administration, and Data Science. These are all instructor-led and designed to quickly equip you with the skills and knowledge to secure an entry-level position in-field. Getting Started For all of our programs, a $1,000 deposit one week before a student’s first day of class is all we require in order to solidify a seat in the starting cohort. Payment Options Finding a payment option that suits your needs is feasible with our different financing options.  Self-Pay: If you opt to pay out of pocket, 50% of the balance will be due on the first day of class, and the remaining 50% will be due 30 days after the first day of class Loans: We have three loan partners that offer flexible repayment, including no payments until 6 months after graduating from our program! Grants: With multiple options available, our grant partners will work to help you find aid to offset the cost of attendance Scholarships: We offer seven different internal scholarships, including Women in Tech, Annie Easley, Minorities in Tech, Pride, Veterans, First-Responders and Covid-19 Relief. VA Benefits: We proudly accept VA benefits as a form of payment for veterans looking to transition to a career in tech. Our Dallas campus specifically accepts VET TEC, and our San Antonio campus accepts VET TEC, GI Bill®/Chapter 33, VRRAP, and Vocational Rehabilitation.  Find a complete breakdown by campus of all of our financial aid options here.

       "  'content': 'Codeup strongly values diversity, and inclusion. In honor of American Business Women’s Day, we’d like to share eight tips and pieces of advice from Codeup’s women in tech for women looking to begin their careers in tech!  “Be confident in what you’re saying. If you’re speaking it’s because you have something to say.” “Don’t over apologize (I do this way too often).” “Be open and willing to speak up to your colleagues on how they can be supportive to everyone in the environment.” “Band with other women to support each other on y’alls journey.” “Find a mentor (and don’t limit yourself to just women mentors, as there aren’t many out there). A mentor can help you establish your career goals, navigate your journey, provide emotional support or motivation, and ultimately help you succeed.” “Do not dismiss or shrug off “humor.” Call out racist, sexist, ableist, etc., comments. Stop letting work colleagues get away with bad behavior. Do this quickly, so it isn’t something that continues to happen.” “Don’t be afraid to ask questions. The other three guys that were hired at the same time as I was NEVER asked any questions, but it turns out they were just as lost as I was. Once I started asking questions in our training meetings, they all started asking away as well! I thought they all understood what was going on, and being the only female in the group, I didn’t want to stick out. This had been holding me back. Instead of being afraid that you will come off as “not getting it”, you will instead hear “That’s a really good question!” or “I’m glad you asked that!”.” “We belong here. Remind yourself of that when you doubt yourself. Because you will. I did. But I belong. And you do, too. So say it like a mantra – I belong here. And believe it.”  Codeup works hard to close the gender inequality gap, and to diversify the tech world by producing a unique blend of tech talent. We also offer a Women in Tech scholarship open to anyone who identifies as a woman. Our goal is to make a career in tech accessible to all. Join us on our journey of empowering women in tech today!

       "  'content': 'With many companies switching to cloud services and implementing cloud infrastructure in their practices, many of us may be wondering…what is cloud computing, and what is AWS? Hopefully, this beginner-friendly guide will answer these questions and give you a foundational understanding of AWS and how cloud infrastructure differs from traditional IT. What is cloud computing? Cloud computing is data hosted via the internet by an independent party. This independent party extends its infrastructure to customers with a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Cloud Service Providers Recently, more organizations have given up physical data centers and are transitioning to the Cloud for their needs. The following are the top Cloud Infrastructure Services providers in 2022:  Amazon Web Services (AWS) Microsoft Azure Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  AWS| Amazon Web Services At Codeup, our Cloud Administration program curriculum focuses on AWS. We prepare students to attempt two certification exams:  AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam AWS Solutions Architect Associate Exam  AWS is the most mature of the cloud service providers, and the lead market provider of cloud services. AWS offers over 200 services, operating globally at a low cost. Cloud-Based Infrastructure vs. Traditional IT Cloud-Based Infrastructure  Select the right resource for your organization based on needs such as power, storage, speed, and network, and easily make adjustments as needed You only pay for what you use Deploying infrastructure globally is easy and achievable in minutes There are no customer costs associated with maintenance, updates, or licensing Security and fault tolerance mechanisms are taken care of by the cloud service provider User data is saved at all times and protected in multiple data centers within a region so in the case of an emergency or disaster, service remains uninterrupted Operating in the cloud is all automated 24/7 trained IT staff is available for customer support  Traditional IT  Organizations will need to acquire and setup servers independently and manually The organization is responsible for maintenance and hardware checkups The organization is responsible for backing up data and setting up a disaster recovery plan An IT staff will need to be hired by the organization When scaling up, it is necessary to acquire more hardware to meet the needs of the organization Scaling up or down is manual and time-consuming Requires a lot of up front capital to purchase the necessary hardware  If you’re interested in jumpstarting your career in tech, and you’re looking into cloud computing our Cloud Administration program may be right for you!
